weights: 0
# The function to measure the quality of a split.
criterion: squared_error
# The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded
# until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
# min_samples_split samples.
max_depth: None
# The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
min_samples_split: 2
# The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
# A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves
# at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and
# right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
# especially in regression.
min_samples_leaf: 1
# The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
# the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal
# weight when sample_weight is not provided.
min_weight_fraction_leaf: 0.0
# The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
# int, float or {“auto”, “sqrt”, “log2”}, default=None
max_features: auto
